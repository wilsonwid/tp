## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts (e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc.) All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `Ui` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `Ui` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `Ui` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Schedule` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the contact manager data, i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), as well as all schedule list data (i.e., all `Schedule` objects, which are contained in a `ScheduleList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Schedule` objects in a manner analogous to the above 'selected' `Person` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model for the `AddressBook` part of `Model` is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/scm/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both contact manager data, user preference data, and schedule list data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage`, and `ScheduleStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of these (if the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `scm.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Importing feature

#### Implementation

The import feature is implemented through the use of `JsonAddressBookStorage`. Given that the user of the application has a JSON file containing contacts in a format similar to the save file of the application, they will be able to import such contacts by providing the filename of the JSON file. The implementation of the feature is somewhat similar to how the application natively reads its own contact manager data, and as such uses similar functions.

This feature implements the following operations, other than the ones it is overriding:

* `ImportCommand#retrievePersonsFromFile()`: Retrieves the `Person`s that are read from a given file and inserts them into a list of `JsonAdaptedPerson`.
* `ImportCommand#readPersons()`: Reads the `Person`s currently inside the file to be read. This command succeeds only if the application is able to read the file and if the file is in the correct JSON format.

This command is implemented in the above manner in order to follow OOP principles more closely, more specifically to prevent any one method from doing too many tasks. Moreover, the reuse of `JsonAddressBookStorage` and other related classes is done in order to aid future development of the feature. Following the same spirit, the logic of this feature is implemented in similar ways to how the application reads its own main save file.

There is initially an alternative considered to refit the entire logic of the model and saving mechanism to fit this import feature. However, the current implementation is chosen over this due to the possibility of rewriting many pieces of unrelated code and of unknowingly breaking other features in the process. Another alternative that was not followed was to only use Jackson-based features to implement the import feature, in order to have more control over the code itself. However, as this feature should integrate with the exporting feature of the application, it became apparent that code reuse should be prioritised.

### Edit schedule feature

#### Implementation

The edit schedule feature is implemented through the use of `EditScheduleDescriptor`. Given a valid index to edit, this command will be able to edit the details of the `Schedule` in such index. The implementation of the feature is similar to that of `EditCommand`.

This feature implements the following operations, other than the methods that it is already overriding:

* `EditScheduleCommand#createEditedSchedule()`: Creates a new `Schedule` given an old schedule to edit as well as an `EditScheduleDescriptor`.

This command is implemented in the above manner to improve its adherence to OOP principles, as well as to allow it to have similarities to the implementation of `EditCommand`. This would allow it to be more extensible and supportive of further development.

### Find schedule feature

#### Implementation

The find schedule feature is implemented through the use of `FindScheduleCommand`. Given a set of attributes (title, description, beforeDateTime, afterDateTime, duringDateTime) to search for, this command will be able to find all schedules that match the all attributes input by the user. The implementation of the feature is similar to that of `FindCommand`.

This command is implemented in the above manner to improve its adherence to OOP principles, as well as to allow it to have similarities to the implementation of `FindCommand`. This would allow it to be more extensible and supportive of further development.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current contact manager state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous contact manager state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone contact manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial contact manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single contact manager state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the contact manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the contact manager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted contact manager state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified contact manager state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the contact manager state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous contact manager state, and restores the contact manager to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the contact manager to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest contact manager state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the contact manager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all contact manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire contact manager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. Designed for users who can type fast, making command execution quicker than using a mouse.
4. Exporting and importing operations should be completed within a reasonable time frame, not exceeding 2 seconds per operation.
5. All other operations should be completed within 500ms, measured after the user has entered an input.
6. The application must ensure the security and privacy of private contact details during import and export operations. Data should be handled in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux (and its various distributions), MacOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Tag**: A keyword or label assigned to a contact to categorize them based on certain criteria or characteristics. Tags allow users to filter and organize contacts more efficiently.
* **Command**: A specific instruction given by the user to the application to perform a particular operation, such as searching, exporting, or importing data.
* **JSON File**: A file format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs. It's used for importing and exporting contact information in the application.
* **Filter Criteria**: The conditions or parameters (such as tag, name, or address) used to search for specific contacts within the application. These criteria help in refining search results to match the user's requirements more closely.
* **Export**: The process of saving data from the application to a file, which can then be used outside the application. This can be particularly useful for creating backups or for using the contact information in other software or services.
* **Import**: The process of adding or updating contacts in the application by loading them from an external file, typically in a structured format like JSON. This allows users to quickly populate the application with a large number of contacts.
* **Contact Manager**: The component or feature of the application that handles the storage, retrieval, organization, and modification of contact information. It is central to the application's functionality regarding managing contact details.
* **Data Directory**: A specific folder or location within the system where the application stores its data files, such as contact exports or imports. The `./data/` directory is an example where JSON files might be found for import operations.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 4

1. Make the `calendar_view` window output more precise: The current `calendar_view` command does not support events that extend beyond one day very well: an event is only displayed on the starting day of the event. We plan to make the event to have specific colour bars that are able to extend beyond one day, allowing the user to better visualise multi-day events better.
2. Allow for symbols inside person names, event titles, and event descriptions: this allows individuals to use their full legal name, as well as allows users to be more flexible with the content of their events titles and descriptions. We plan to allow for symbols such as `/`, `-`, and `@` inside the aforementioned fields to better accommodate users.
3. Allow for more variety on input formats: the use of `add` and `add_schedule` can be somewhat cumbersome as the user has to type out several fields in order for the application to accept the user input. We plan to allow for more flexibility on the required fields, such as by reducing the requirement to add a person to only a phone number or email. For schedules, we plan to have descriptions, start time, and end time to be optional fields.
4. Exporting people according to any searchable criteria: Currently, `find_and_export` only supports finding and exporting persons with the same tag. We plan to create another `export` command that would allow the exporting of individuals with any criteria, such as names, contact numbers, addresses, etc.
5. Overflow when adding schedules: There is an issue with regards to medium- and long-length titles for schedules. We plan to accommodate longer event titles by adding scrolling and text wrapping up to a certain length (e.g., 30 characters for titles, 200 characters for descriptions).
6. Overflow when adding contacts: there may be UI overflow issues when adding contacts that have long names, phone numbers, or addresses. We plan to fix this by both having text wrapping and limiting the length of such fields to reasonable lengths (e.g., 50 characters for names, 20 characters for phone numbers, and 200 characters for addresses).)
